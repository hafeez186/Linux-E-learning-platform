# Linux E-Learning Platform - Deployment Status

## 🚀 Live Demo
- **Local Development**: http://localhost:3000
- **GitHub Pages**: https://hafeez186.github.io/Linux-E-learning-platform

## � Troubleshooting GitHub Actions

### Problem: Exit Code 128 Error
This usually indicates git permission or repository configuration issues.

### Solutions Implemented:
1. ✅ Simplified workflow with basic git operations
2. ✅ Added `force_orphan: true` to avoid git history conflicts
3. ✅ Created multiple workflow options for testing
4. ✅ Used `working-directory` instead of `cd` commands
5. ✅ **Fixed git submodule issue**: Removed broken submodule reference and added client/ as regular files

### Alternative Deployment Methods:

**Option 1: Manual GitHub Pages Setup**
1. Go to Settings > Pages
2. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branch: "gh-pages"
4. Wait for automated deployment

**Option 2: Local Build + Manual Upload**
1. Run `cd client && npm run build`
2. Upload `client/build` folder contents to gh-pages branch
3. Enable GitHub Pages

**Option 3: Use Netlify (Recommended if GitHub keeps failing)**
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Build command: `cd client && npm run build`
4. Publish directory: `client/build`
5. Deploy

## 📋 Current Status
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Multiple deployment workflows created
- ✅ **FIXED**: Submodule issue resolved (client/ directory now tracked properly)
- ✅ Local build tested and working
- ⏳ GitHub Actions deployment should now work correctly
